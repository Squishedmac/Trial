This app detects the age range and the gender of the person/ people in a given image as requested.

Be sure to have an active network connection since the app uses a model hosted on the cloud for prediction and inference.
The model uses YOLOv5 for classification and the ui uses tkinter, the app is completely python based, make sure the images uploaded are jpg.
I have attatched some images as sampless for testing. Or you can test on images of your own :).
On launch windows might say the app could be malicious but thats because the application isnt vetted by microsoft, rest assured its perfectly safe.
If theres an error stating the image couldnt be written on to the device the app may have to be launched as admin.
